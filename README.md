## Anonymous Q&A

*December 2023*

This application is a question-and-answer site where users post questions and answers to these questions anonymously. This "single page app" is created using AJAX calls instead of regular page rendering and form submission.

Additional functionality includes: 

- fetch requests
- sending back JSON objects from Express
- implement routes to create an API for retrieving questions and adding new ones
- use JavaScript to trigger background requests to the API from the form submit buttons

## Blackjack

*November 2023*

This project implements a player vs. computer game of blackjack. The DOM elements are manipulated with JavaScript such that the game is replayable with no page refresh required. Although each new round generates a new, randomly shuffled deck, the program prompts the user with a text box at the beginning where the player can choose card values to be pulled to the top of the deck. The computer's logic of when to draw or stand is determined by whether the computer's hand has exceeded 18 points. 

Additional functionality: 

- manipulating the DOM by creating and adding elements
- setting DOM element attributes
- handling events with addEventListener
- stopping form submission with preventDefault
- using CSS to arrange elements with position and display
- using AJAX to make background requests
